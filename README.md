1,000 anti-rabies
1,000 antirabic reinforcements

Each state benefits equally, but the number of pets has increased considerably, so in each state there is a group of people who hold a previous event to raise funds and acquire more vaccines, so when the In each campaign, there may be more Vaccines available for the day of the event.
